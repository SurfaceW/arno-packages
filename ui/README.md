# UI Package

This package contains shared UI components and utilities for front-end development. It includes:

- Client-side components, potentially leveraging libraries like Ant Design (`ui/client/antd-client`).
- Application providers and theme configurations (`ui/client/app-provider`).
- UI elements like backgrounds, error boundaries, and text components (`ui/client/background`, `ui/client/error-boundary`, `ui/client/text`).
- Favicon generation utilities (`ui/client/favicon`).
- Form components and related utilities (`ui/client/form`).
- Custom React hooks for various functionalities (`ui/client/hooks`).

The components are likely designed to be used within a React-based environment.
